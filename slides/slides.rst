Intro
=====

Git is a free and open source version control tool.

As of 2014, GitHub reports having over 3.4 million users and with 16.7 million
repositories making it the largest code host in the world

=====
Steps
=====

    #. Pick a project to contribute to
    #. Fork the project's repository
    #. Make your changes
    #. Submit a pull request

==============
Pick a Project
==============

    - Use open source projects
    - Find bugs
    - Find absent features
    - Look through Issues

================
Fork The Project
================

    - Creates a copy of the whole repository under your username
    - Allows you to make changes to the code without affecting work that has
      already been done
    - Can fork as many projects as you want to

=================
Make Your Changes
=================

    - Most important part
    - Make sure to test
    - Follow existing coding guidelines (CONTRIBUTING.md)
    - Comment any functions/classes you add
    - Commit often and use descriptive commit messages (http://whatthecommit.com/)
    - Push to origin after done with commits

=====================
Submit a Pull Request
=====================

    - Allows the maintainers of the project to decide weather or not to
      integrate your code with the main repository
    - Include explicit description (this does not mean with expletives)
    - Maintainers may ask for clarifiction or changes so that your code more
      cleanly integrates with existing code.

==========
Next Steps
==========

    - One of two things will happen

        - Your code gets merged
        - Your code doesn't get merged

======
Merged
======

    - You are now a valued member of a free software project
    - Future pull requests can be merged easier
    - You learned something!

========
No Merge
========

    - Project has lazy maintainers
    - You didn't test well enough
    - Feature is already being worked on by someone else
    - You learned something!
